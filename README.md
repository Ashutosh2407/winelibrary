# Winelibrary - A Taste-Driven Wine Search Engine for Connoisseurs 

## Overview

**WineLibrary** (https://www.wineslibrary.com/) is a personalized wine search engine designed to help users find the perfect bottle tailored to their unique taste preferences. 
Instead of browsing endless wine lists, users can simply describe what they’re craving — like *“fruity and bold with a hint of spice”* — and WineLibrary will return curated recommendations that match their palate.

Built with Python, Django, and Scikit-learn, this project uses natural language processing to interpret flavor descriptions and match them with the right wines. It's a solo project aimed at making wine discovery intuitive, fun, and taste-driven.
